## Nate's bio

Nathan Drake was born in the year of 1976 as Nathan Morgan, the second son of American archaeologist Cassandra Morgan and her husband, and the younger brother of Samuel Morgan, who was older than him by five years.

In 1981, when Nathan was five, his mother Cassandra had been suffering from an unknown terminal illness, which soon led to her suicide. Following the death of Cassandra, Nathan and Samuel's father decided to give up his hold on them and surrender his sons to the state. Not long afterward, both boys were entrusted to the Saint Francis' Boy's Home, a Catholic orphanage ran by nuns and priests. All of their mother's possessions — including her archaeological works — were later sold by their father.
